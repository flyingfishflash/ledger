 * Base Interface that has to be implemented by any Entity/Object to be used by
 * NestedNodeRepository.
 *
 * <p>It is strongly recommented to follow Java-bean naming standards. It is important expecially
 * for JPA implementation. JPA Criteria Queries are constructed using the constants defined in this
 * interface. In order for NestedJ to work corerctly you have to follow this rule. It is not
 * required by other implementations, but still it is recommended.
 *
 * <p>Although Nested Set model doesn't require the presence of PARENT_ID mapping, it is required by
 * NestedJ. Nested Set Model is a very fragile construct. One manual upadte can destroy the tree
 * beyond repair. NestedJ uses PARENT_ID mapping to srenghten the Tree Structure and to be able to
 * repair the Nested Set Model if needed.
